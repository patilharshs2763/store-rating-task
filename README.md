> **🔐 Admin Setup:**  
> To create the initial **System Administrator**, use the `registerUser` API and explicitly pass `"role": "System Administrator"` in the request body:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "name": "Admin Name",
>   "email": "admin@example.com",
>   "password": "Admin@123",
>   "address": "City Name",
>   "role": "System Administrator"
> }
> ```
>
> Once registered, this user can:
> - Log in to the admin dashboard  
> - Create and manage users and stores  
> - Assign roles  
>
> 🔄 For regular users, the `role` field is optional and defaults to **Normal User**.
